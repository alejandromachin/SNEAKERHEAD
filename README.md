Welcome to SNEAKERHEAD, a place to sell and buy yout favorite pair of sneakers.

This project is built using REACT and Typescript on its core, and some other libraries and packages to make it run as smooth as possible.

To start, we highly recommend to run "npm install/yarn install" to install all the packages needed to run this app.

Then, the three main scripts you will need from there on are:

- npm start: runs the app in a local port.
- npm build: create the build of the app.
- npm test: run all the testing suits of the app.

You can also find a list of the rest of the scripts in the package.json file.

Thanks for your interest in this app.
